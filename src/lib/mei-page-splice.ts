// Joining per-page encoding into the shared score. A facsimile campaign splits
// encoding into one task per page (locator `surface-N`); every volunteer edits
// a copy of the whole `sources/score.mei`, but a page task's accepted PR must
// contribute only that page's notation, leaving the other pages as they stand
// in the base file. Pure functions: MEI text in, MEI text out. No DOM,
// filesystem or network access.
//
// A page's extent is delimited by the `<pb/>` markers written at stage C
// (mei-facsimile.ts): the page's `<pb facs="#surface-N"/>` opens it and the
// next page's `<pb/>` (or the end of the enclosing element, on the last page)
// closes it. The join keeps the base file verbatim outside that span and takes
// the fork's span content wholesale, so everything the volunteer wrote inside
// their page — measures, a mid-piece <scoreDef>, added or removed measures —
// lands in the base. The base's own `<pb/>` markers stay authoritative: which
// surface follows the page comes from the base's page order, both spans are
// delimited by the same facs-matched `<pb>` elements, and the result is
// checked afterwards (assertSpliceIntegrity) so a fork that smuggles in a
// page break or a duplicate measure is rejected rather than merged.
