// Background verdicts for PR commands that return before the campaign
// automation has processed their PR. Each optimistic command registers an
// entry when its PR opens; the entry settles when the automation's verdict
// lands. The entries render task-anchored (TaskRunState.svelte); rejections
// additionally take the viewport over (PendingVerdicts.svelte, in the
// layout); pages hook their table refresh into onSettled. Loading this module
// plugs the store into the command layer's verdict sink — commands.ts itself
// stays free of runes so the Node test runner can import it.
