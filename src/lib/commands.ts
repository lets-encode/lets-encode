// The console command layer: every user-facing campaign operation is a named,
// versioned command with JSON-serialisable input, run through invoke(). The
// UI is one caller among possible others (an agent can drive the same
// registry), and every MUTATING command fills the command columns of one row
// in the campaign's append-only tracking/history.csv:
//   - log 'pr':     the mutation travels as a pull request; the envelope rides
//                   in the PR body and the campaign automation folds it into
//                   the history row it authors for the event (volunteers
//                   cannot write to the campaign repo).
//   - log 'direct': the command mutates without a PR (requires push access);
//                   invoke() commits the history row itself after the command ran.
//   - log 'none':   reads — not logged.
// Handlers are self-contained: they read the tracking tables themselves rather
// than relying on caller state. See DESIGN.md §5 (history.csv) & §6.
