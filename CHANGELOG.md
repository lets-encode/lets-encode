- An accepted measure or layout correction rebuilds the piece's page tasks so pages without measures get no task.

## 2026-09-28

- The npm package is renamed to lets-encode.
- References follow the repository renames to lets-encode and campaign-template.
- A new campaign gets its own README and no longer keeps the template's own files.
- The campaign workflow's job lives in `.github/workflows/campaign.yml`, which each campaign's caller.yml calls.
- Completing a task in mei-friend submits it for review; the Submit buttons are removed.
- mei-friend opens in the same tab and returns to the task's campaign page.
- The task panel shows the error mei-friend reports when a task could not be completed.
- A task just completed in mei-friend is highlighted in place of the next task for five minutes.
- Claimed tasks and review slots can be given back, also from mei-friend.
- The coordinator accepts a pull request that removes the author's own lock row.
- A new encoding claim starts the task branch from the current score.
- The campaigns page shows Open editor instead of Continue for encoding work you hold.
- An encoding claim still being processed holds the claim and editor buttons until its verdict lands.
- Setup tasks in your open work open their own editor instead of mei-friend.
- An OMR page draft's note no longer stops the editor from opening.
- Claim & open in mei-friend goes to mei-friend as soon as the claim is accepted, without Continue.
- An encoding completed without changes can be submitted.
- The coordinator finds an encoding submission's task from its command envelope or task branch, not from the changed file.
- Claim buttons read Claim task, or Claim & open in mei-friend for an encoding.
- The buttons that reopen a held encoding read Open in mei-friend.
- The OMR task that corrects staff and measure boxes is called measure correction, like the one without OMR.
- Result banners no longer have a coloured left edge.
- The score setup and zone editors share one implementation of their claim, review and comment handling.
- The campaigns page shows the mei-friend link when the browser blocks the new tab.
- The score setup and zone editor result banners have a Dismiss button.
- Box editing, panel resizing, result banners, comment anchors and piece labels each have one shared implementation.
- The SPA fallback moves from `static/.htaccess` to the virtual host.

## 2026-09-25

- Repo paths, page locators, work stages, the MEI opening and the OCR settings are each defined once.
- Board cards show the piece colour as a dot before the title instead of a coloured left edge.
- The console shows lock expiry with the coordinator's 120-minute default when the config sets none.
- The campaign name `ocr` is reserved.
- Unused code and stale comments are removed.
- Code is formatted with Prettier (2 spaces) and the broker with Black (80 columns).
- A pre-commit hook rejects unformatted files.
- The mei-friend URL is set only in `services.json`.
- OMR layout correction has a grand-staff step between the staff boxes and the measures.
- The coordinator keeps the Musibot models of an OMR page draft in the score header when it splices the page.
- Instrument labels are read in front of an indented system too, such as a piano introduction.
- The wizard's OMR option says the staves are transcribed in the score setup.
- OMR staff assignment runs through the whole piece, following the staves the previous system showed, with the clef only breaking ties.
- OMR page drafts start in the clefs, key and meter the earlier pages leave in force and apply the clef corrections made in the score setup.
- Score setup of an OMR piece transcribes every staff into `omr.xml`, and page drafts are made from it.
- The coordinator commits the `layout.json` and `omr.xml` a pre-task submits beside its score.
- OMR page drafts keep the recognised clefs and change key or meter only where most staves of a system read the change.

## 2026-09-24

- OMR page drafts no longer fail the MEI schema check when a clef change follows a tremolo.
- OMR page drafts keep every staff of the score, so a system that leaves out staves no longer shifts the staves below.
- OMR page drafts place the staves of a shorter system on their score staves by clef, printed instrument label and staff spacing.
- Score setup of an OMR piece fills in the instrument labels printed in front of the first system.
- OMR page drafts keep each staff in its score clef, correcting the pitches of a staff whose clef was misread.
- OMR transcription runs at most 16 staves at once and retries requests the broker rate limit refused.

## 2026-09-23

- Layout correction of an OMR piece can be submitted once every page was shown in both steps and no page has staff boxes without measures.
- The volunteer view lists every submission still being processed, not only when no task is open.
- Committed page images keep the source's full resolution, so OMR staff crops match a direct Musibot run.
- OMR page drafts take their systems from the corrected measure rows, so a system without staff boxes no longer shifts the music after it.
- Score setup of an OMR piece takes its staff count from the largest system of the corrected layout.
- Coordinator retries GitHub 5xx reads and falls back to the commit's file list when GitHub cannot serve a one-commit PR's diff.
- A failed automation run reads "Run failed" instead of "Rejected".
- Retrying a campaign finish no longer recommits the campaign once its config is in the repository.
- Campaign setup no longer adopts an existing repository that already holds a finished campaign.
- Campaign pages show an error when the registry cannot be reached instead of reporting the campaign as not found.
- Coordinator decides each pull request once, so a second run no longer rejects an operation it already accepted.
- Broker relay responses are sent as sandboxed downloads, so a relayed SVG or HTML file cannot run script in the app origin.
- Broker trusts X-Forwarded-Host behind the reverse proxy, so writes no longer fail the same-origin check in production.
- Layout correction keeps the layout model's output per page in the browser, so reopening the task before submitting skips the model run.
- Score setup of an OMR piece no longer offers to fill from recognition again.

## 2026-09-21

- Review record: the Pass and Fail buttons of a held slot sit on their own line.
- Volunteer view: open-task rows show a claim button only when the viewer can claim the task, and review slots read "Claim to review".
- Score setup of an OMR piece groups staves into systems by the measure boxes that span them, and single-staff systems no longer vote on the staff count.
- Layout correction of an OMR piece runs in two steps, staff boxes then measures, and commits the model's raw output as `layout.json` beside the score.
- Zone editor reworked: per-step boxes, two-step control with Next, click-only measure controls, side-by-side two-page view, drag threshold for new boxes.
- Pre-task editors and the review view submit in the background and return to the campaign page; the run state shows on the board, task panel and volunteer view.
- Claiming an OMR task runs the layout detection or clef/signature recognition in the claim overlay.
- Wizard: fit-to-width and fit-to-page zoom, pages-per-row default from the page count, other unfinished setups resumable from the rail.

## 0.34.0 – 2026-09-18

- Encoding tasks of an OMR piece ("Correct the draft · page N" on the board) start from a transcription: when the task is opened, the page's staves are cropped, transcribed with the Musibot staff pipeline, stitched into a page score, converted with verovio, inserted into the page's measures and committed to the task branch before mei-friend opens; mismatches and failed staves are reported.
- Score setup of an OMR piece: staff count from the layout and editable while the piece holds no notation; clefs pre-filled from the system with the most staves, key and meter from the first system, when the task is opened (redo button). The submission rebuilds the empty measures for the definition, or replaces the definition alone once transcriptions are in.
- Zone editor: a layout-correction task runs the Musibot layout model when its claim holder opens it, shows staff boxes as a second, editable layer (Measures/Staves tool), and submits staff zones with empty measures (`campaign.submitOmrLayout`).
- Broker relays the Musibot OMR service at `/omr` (login-gated, a fixed set of endpoints, file transfers restricted to the service's host; `MUSIBOT_URL`, `MUSIBOT_TOKEN`); the console gets a client for it and the models are pinned in `services.json`. Nothing calls it yet.
- Wizard: a Preparation step after Pieces chooses measure detection or optical music recognition for the facsimile pieces and finishes the setup; measure detection now runs on Finish, not while pieces are marked. OMR pieces get a layout pre-task (`omr-layout`) instead of measure correction; recognition itself is not wired up yet. Steps with nothing to do are left out of the step rail.

## 0.33.0 – 2026-09-15

- Board stacks its lanes instead of scrolling sideways; the task panel floats and the piece rail shrinks to dots before that happens. Piece rail shows per-category counts as cards.
- SPA config is committed in `instances-config/` and the build mode follows the checked-out branch.
- Sign-in banner names the unreachable broker instead of showing a JSON parse error.
- Build output moves to `website/`, the project website to `static/`; `deploy/` removed.
- Tests read caller.yml from the template repository on GitHub.
- Volunteer view redesigned: next-task card, filterable open-task list, pieces table.
- Comments panel: 380px default width, one toggle button outside the panel in every view.
- Volunteer view is keyboard- and screen-reader-accessible and stacks below 700px.
- Small controls are at least 24px tall (WCAG 2.2 AA).
- Accessibility: page titles, heading structure, focus ring on search, hidden decorative separators.
- Top bar and campaign filter bar wrap on narrow screens.
- Palette: lighter surfaces, one deep tone per stage colour for 4.5:1 text contrast.
- Board lanes are coloured as their stage; the dashed well is gone.
- Open-work rows on landing page share one height; their buttons are compact.
- One SVG icon set replaces the unicode glyphs.
- Copy says "submission" instead of "PR".
- Copy: plainer empty-state and Manage-view wording.
- Status pills are shorter with centred text.
- UI text: "review" replaces "validation", "measure correction" names the pre-task, "done" is the final state.

## 0.32.0 – 2026-09-03

- Console: a run cancelled because a newer push to the same pull request replaced it is no longer reported as a failure; the console keeps waiting for the pull request's verdict.
- Console: when the campaign workflow's guard skips a pull request's run, the console names the requirement (at most two files, no draft, a user account), closes the pull request and asks for a corrected submission, instead of reporting a failed run.
- Task panel: a submission made within the last minute reads "just now" instead of "now ago".
- Dev server: serves the vendored libxml2-wasm from `scripts/vendor`, so the browser-side MEI check also runs in development.
- Console: a zones, setup or encoding submission is checked against the MEI schema in the browser before its pull request opens (same validator and schema as the automation); a failing score is refused with the line and message. If the check itself cannot run, the submission proceeds and the automation decides.
- Coordinator: a pull request's head branch is deleted only after the pull request is closed. Deleting it in parallel closed the pull request first and made the close request fail, which failed the run (and mailed the campaign owner) although the verdict had been recorded.
- Coordinator: discussion comment rows carry the pull request's creation time as their timestamp, so a discussion keeps its submission order when runs finish in another order; locks, state, history and a fail's comment keep the processing time.
- Coordinator: scheduled runs process open pull requests whose own run was lost (cancelled, skipped or failed), oldest first, three minutes to seven days old, at most twenty per pass; drafts and bot pull requests are left alone.
- Coordinator: an author with more than ten open pull requests on a campaign has further ones closed unprocessed.
- Coordinator: a pull request that does not parse as any operation (malformed, out of bounds, unknown task) is closed with its comment and writes no history row; rejections of well-formed operations still do.
- MEI machine-check: runs in-process on a vendored WebAssembly build of libxml2 (`scripts/vendor/libxml2-wasm`, MIT); nothing is installed on the runner and the error text is unchanged.
- Coordinator: the pull request and the first page of its files are read together, and the branch head is read with its tree in one call, so a run makes two fewer GitHub round trips.
- Coordinator: up to five optimistic-concurrency attempts with a random pause between them, since runs for different pull requests now execute concurrently.
- Test suite: the caller workflow test also checks that the central pointer is validated and never expanded into a command, and that pull request runs get their own concurrency group.

## 0.31.0 – 2026-09-03

- Volunteer view: the task column scrolls again when its content is taller than the window.
- Volunteer view: each piece row counts its open work per stage (purple preparation, orange review, blue encoding); task rows and suggestions show fail/comment/question chips.
- Piece colours are muted, so they read as identity tints and cannot be mistaken for the saturated stage colours; the order is unchanged.
- Measure corrector: a measure is deleted with a trashcan in the selected box's top-right corner, as in the wizard's region editor; the ✕ leaves the control pill.

## 0.30.0 – 2026-09-02

- Removed the unused tile-preview path from the campaign stats loader.
- Test suite: checks that the campaign repos' caller workflow never checks out or executes the PR head — it may reach the coordinator only as env data.
- Score preview: a two-page score opens with both pages side by side; a view or recto choice made by the user holds for the rest of the session.
- Instigator board: every kanban card carries a score link that opens the score view at the task's page.
- Score toolbars (score preview, zones editor): two fit buttons with icons, fit width and fit whole page; the whole-page fit is the default and the chosen fit follows the window size until the zoom slider is moved.
- Comments panel: a switch hides resolved threads.
- Wizard pieces step: metadata can be copied from any other piece, chosen from a dropdown, not only the previous one.
- Wizard pieces step: Finish stays disabled while a facsimile piece has no regions, unless the piece is marked "No regions on purpose"; the selected piece's metadata sits in a box in the piece's colour, with the Short/Detailed/XML switch directly above the fields.
- Region and measure drawing works in any direction, not only towards the lower right.
- Wizard region editor: region edges snap to neighbouring regions while drawing, resizing or moving, so regions sit exactly side by side.
- Wizard: the piece title field's placeholder no longer says "source", which names the whole book in the wizard.
- Volunteer view: the task mosaic in the header is one row per piece, cells in the piece's colour.
- Claim buttons carry their stage colour: purple for preparation tasks, orange for review, blue for encoding.
- Zones and setup views: the validation box shows only the action open to you (Claim, or Pass/Fail once you hold the slot) instead of disabled buttons.
- Score preview: the rendered encoding uses pages of the facsimile's proportions (A4 without a facsimile), systems spread over the page when breaks are encoded, and one page size per score, grown until the densest page fits.

## 0.29.0 – 2026-09-01

- Facsimile pre-tasks swapped: measure correction comes first, score setup second; a piece's encoding tasks now depend on the setup task. New campaigns only.

## 0.28.0 – 2026-09-01

- Instigator board: the task panel opens by default with the last-viewed task (or the first card); the info panel sits between the title and the stats bar, its values in a fixed label column; fail/comment/question chips show on every non-done card.
- Piece rail widened and roomier, with dividing lines between pieces; counts read as words under the progress bar (3 open · 1 review), unresolved comments as a speech-bubble count.
- Dark mode: the page canvas keeps a slight tinge where the glows fade out, and the recessed surfaces (board wells, rail, desk) are lightened a step — nothing sinks to near-black any more.

## 0.27.0 – 2026-09-01

- The review, zones and setup pages lose their sidebars: the task's status, actions and validation controls sit in a task box pinned at the top of the comments panel.
- The task panel on the campaign page pins its task card above the scrolling discussion.
- Zones editor: undo/redo moved into the toolbar; the hints and legend sit behind a help icon.

## 0.26.0 – 2026-09-01

- Volunteer board recomposed: centred layout, large next-task page preview, task types, per-task progress cells, contributors and last merge in the header.
- Comments and task panels share one width; the comments panel shrinks to its content while a piece has no comments.
- Piece rows: "View score" button, larger thumbnails; a single piece stays expanded.

## 0.25.0 – 2026-09-01

- Volunteer view rebuilt: the next task as a hero card with claim and preview actions, three suggested alternatives, expandable piece rows, and the piece-scoped comments panel (sectioned per task, measure anchors, resizable) beside it.
- Instigator view: a piece rail with per-category task counts scopes the full-width board, cards carry their piece's colour, and an in-page task panel replaces the dock takeover; the columns list every card, filterable by an All tasks / Claimable toggle.
- Full-page score view at ?score= replaces the score dock: comment anchors page and highlight the score, a selected measure targets the composer, and the comments panel also joins the setup, zones and review viewers.
- Campaign overview as full-width rows with the suggested next task claimable in place and one search & filter bar; the retired dock components are removed.

## 0.24.0 – 2026-09-01

- Banner text on the setup and zones task pages is left-aligned again.
- Posting or resolving a comment shows a spinner at the composer or comment instead of the task's run state.
- Background submissions no longer show the busy overlay popup.

## 0.23.0 – 2026-08-28

- Task-first volunteer view instead of the board (next task, open tasks grouped and tinted per piece, piece progress); the board stays for instigators.
- Task panel: one status pill plus the one available action; claim-to-review moved into the header.
- Board cards are navigation-only; the hero claim button covers reviews too.
- "Needs attention" unfolds its tasks; the column flag is gone.
- The piece tiles' "View score" replaces "Preview the score"; "ready" is now "open".
- Removed "Copy raw link".

## 0.22.2 – 2026-08-28

- The board tints each task an accepted submission (encoding, validation, send-back) of the viewer's just moved, with a "just submitted" badge, for one minute.
- The Done column now lists the five most recently finished tasks as cards, newest first, collapsing only the rest into the summary; done lines show the pass hand instead of a tick.
- Card footers (claim, waits-for, worker, validation dots, completion line) now sit at the card's bottom edge instead of leaving the uniform card height unused.
- Task titles now name the piece (config title, else its id) everywhere — board cards, task panel, review view, ticker, plan editor and dashboard — instead of the score file's basename.
- The Manage button now matches the size of the other hero buttons.
- Restyled the banners to match the app design (wash background, coloured left edge, ink text) and unified their styles and placement across all pages.
- A rate-limited campaign page now reports the failed lookup with a retry instead of claiming the campaign does not exist.
- Redesigned the GitHub-interaction status messages. (`05ca5cb`)
- Added this changelog, reconstructed from the full git history.
- Synced the package version with the changelog.
- Moved the design and spec docs (DESIGN.md, SECURITY-HARDENING.md, mei-friend-connect spec, scholarly-metadata plan, meeting notes) to the private lets-encode-meta repo; the README points there.
